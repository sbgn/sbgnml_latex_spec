  abstract     = {Cancerogenesis is driven by mutations leading to aberrant functioning of a complex network of molecular interactions and simultaneously affecting multiple cellular functions. Therefore, the successful application of bioinformatics and systems biology methods for analysis of high-throughput data in cancer research heavily depends on availability of global and detailed reconstructions of signalling networks amenable for computational analysis. We present here the Atlas of Cancer Signalling Network (ACSN), an interactive and comprehensive map of molecular mechanisms implicated in cancer. The resource includes tools for map navigation, visualization and analysis of molecular data in the context of signalling network maps. Constructing and updating ACSN involves careful manual curation of molecular biology literature and participation of experts in the corresponding fields. The cancer-oriented content of ACSN is completely original and covers major mechanisms involved in cancer progression, including DNA repair, cell survival, apoptosis, cell cycle, EMT and cell motility. Cell signalling mechanisms are depicted in detail, together creating a seamless 'geographic-like' map of molecular interactions frequently deregulated in cancer. The map is browsable using NaviCell web interface using the Google Maps engine and semantic zooming principle. The associated web-blog provides a forum for commenting and curating the ACSN content. ACSN allows uploading heterogeneous omics data from users on top of the maps for visualization and performing functional analyses. We suggest several scenarios for ACSN application in cancer research, particularly for visualizing high-throughput data, starting from small interfering RNA-based screening results or mutation frequencies to innovative ways of exploring transcriptomes and phosphoproteomes. Integration and analysis of these data in the context of ACSN may help interpret their biological significance and formulate mechanistic hypotheses. ACSN may also support patient stratification, prediction of treatment response and resistance to cancer drugs, as well as design of novel treatment strategies.},

    for translation errors and assuring a common starting point for analyses
    and simulations. This document provides the specification for Release 2
    of Version 2 of SBML Level 3 Core. The specification defines the data
    structures prescribed by SBML as well as their encoding in XML, the eXtensible
    Markup Language. Release 2 corrects some errors and clarifies some ambiguities
    discovered in Release 1. This specification also defines validation rules that

  abstract = {Background: Systems biology projects and omics technologies have
    led to a growing number of biochemical pathway models and reconstructions.
        However, the majority of these models are still created de novo,
        based on literature mining and the manual processing of pathway data.
        
        Results: To increase the efficiency of model creation, the Path2Models
        project has automatically generated mathematical models from pathway
        representations using a suite of freely available software. Data
        sources include KEGG, BioCarta, MetaCyc and SABIO-RK. Depending on
        the source data, three types of models are provided: kinetic, logical
        and constraint-based. Models from over 2~600 organisms are encoded
        consistently in SBML, and are made freely available through BioModels
        Database at \url{http://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels-main/path2models}.
        Each model contains the list of participants, their interactions,
        the relevant mathematical constructs, and initial parameter values.
        Most models are also available as easy-to-understand graphical SBGN
        maps.
        
        Conclusions: To date, the project has resulted in more than
        140~000 freely available models. Such a resource can tremendously
        accelerate the development of mathematical models by providing initial
        starting models for simulation and analysis, which can be subsequently
        curated and further parameterized.},

As a web server, PathWhiz is accessible from almost any place and compatible with essentially any operating system. It also houses a public library of pathways and pathway components that can be easily viewed and expanded upon by its users. PathWhiz allows users to readily generate biologically complex pathways by using a specially designed drawing palette to quickly render metabolites (including automated structure generation), proteins (including quaternary structures, covalent modifications and cofactors), nucleic acids, membranes, subcellular structures, cells, tissues and organs. Both small-molecule and protein/gene pathways can be constructed by combining multiple pathway processes such as reactions, interactions, binding events and transport activities. PathWhiz's pathway replication and propagation functions allow for existing pathways to be used to create new pathways or for existing pathways to be automatically propagated across species. PathWhiz pathways can be saved in BioPAX, SBGN-ML and SBML data exchange formats, as well as PNG, PWML, HTML image map or SVG images that can be viewed offline or explored using PathWhiz's interactive viewer. PathWhiz has been used to generate over 700 pathway diagrams for a number of popular databases including HMDB, DrugBank and SMPDB.},

In the past year, major improvements include a large expansion of classification information available in PANTHER, as well as significant enhancements to the analysis tools. Protein subfamily functional classifications have more than doubled due to progress of the Gene Ontology Phylogenetic Annotation Project. For human genes (as well as a few other organisms), PANTHER now also supports enrichment analysis using pathway classifications from the Reactome resource. The gene list enrichment tools include a new 'hierarchical view' of results, enabling users to leverage the structure of the classifications/ontologies; the tools also allow users to upload genetic variant data directly, rather than requiring prior conversion to a gene list. The updated coding single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) scoring tool uses an improved algorithm. The hidden Markov model (HMM) search tools now use HMMER3, dramatically reducing search times and improving accuracy of E-value statistics.

        data-rich visualizations of biological pathways},
  abstract = {Escher is a web application for visualizing data on biological
        pathways. Three key features make Escher a uniquely effective tool for
        pathway visualization. First, users can rapidly design new pathway maps.
        Escher provides pathway suggestions based on user data and genome-scale
        models, so users can draw pathways in a semi-automated way. Second, users
        can visualize data related to genes or proteins on the associated reactions
        and pathways, using rules that define which enzmyes catalyze each reaction.
        Thus, users can identify trends in common genomic data types (e.g., RNA-Seq,
        proteomics, ChIP) in conjunction with metabolite- and reaction-oriented data
        types (e.g., metabolomics, fluxomics). Third, Escher harnesses the strengths
        of web technologies (SVG, D3, developer tools) so that visualizations can be
        rapidly adapted, extended, shared, and embedded. This paper provides
        examples of each of these features and explains how the development approach
        used for Escher can be used to guide the development of future visualization
        tools.},

STON exploits the power of graph databases to store and query complex biological pathways. This advances the possibility of: i) identifying subnetworks in a given pathway; ii) linking networks across different levels of granularity to address difficulties related to incomplete knowledge representation at single level; and iii) identifying common patterns between pathways in the database.},

  abstract        = {Information about cellular processes and pathways is becoming increasingly available in detailed, computable standard formats such as BioPAX and SBGN. Effective visualization of this information is a key recurring requirement for biological data analysis, especially for -omic data. Biological data analysis is rapidly migrating to web based platforms; thus there is a substantial need for sophisticated web based pathway viewers that support these platforms and other use cases. Towards this goal, we developed a web based viewer named SBGNViz for process description maps in SBGN (SBGN-PD). SBGNViz can visualize both BioPAX and SBGN formats. Unique features of SBGNViz include the ability to nest nodes to arbitrary depths to represent molecular complexes and cellular locations, automatic pathway layout, editing and highlighting facilities to enable focus on sub-maps, and the ability to inspect pathway members for detailed information from EntrezGene. SBGNViz can be used within a web browser without any installation and can be readily embedded into web pages. SBGNViz has two editions built with ActionScript and JavaScript. The JavaScript edition, which also works on touch enabled devices, introduces novel methods for managing and reducing complexity of large SBGN-PD maps for more effective analysis. SBGNViz fills an important gap by making the large and fast-growing corpus of rich pathway information accessible to web based platforms. SBGNViz can be used in a variety of contexts and in multiple scenarios ranging from visualization of the results of a single study in a web page to building data analysis platforms.},

However, the interoperability between the Systems Biology Graphical Notation (SBGN) Markup Language (SBGN-ML) and the CellDesigner's proprietary Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) extension formats remains a challenge due to the proprietary extensions used in CellDesigner files. We introduce a library named cd2sbgnml and an associated web service for bidirectional conversion between CellDesigner's proprietary SBML extension and SBGN-ML formats. We discuss the functionality of the cd2sbgnml converter, which was successfully used for the translation of comprehensive large-scale diagrams such as the RECON Human Metabolic network (Noronha et al., 2019) and the complete Atlas of Cancer Signalling Network (Kuperstein et al., 2015), from the CellDesigner file format into SBGN-ML. The cd2sbgnml conversion library and the web service were developed in Java, and distributed under the GNU Lesser General Public License v3.0.

Finally, the export of such maps to public websites, including clickable images, supports the communication of results within the scientific community.

Ironically, despite having one of the highest ratios of graphical to textual information, biology still lacks standard graphical notations. The recent deluge of biological knowledge makes addressing this deficit a pressing concern. Toward this goal, we present the Systems Biology Graphical Notation (SBGN), a visual language developed by a community of biochemists, modelers and computer scientists. SBGN consists of three complementary languages: process diagram, entity relationship diagram and activity flow diagram. Together they enable scientists to represent networks of biochemical interactions in a standard, unambiguous way. We believe that SBGN will foster efficient and accurate representation, visualization, storage, exchange and reuse of information on all kinds of biological knowledge, from gene regulation, to metabolism, to cellular signaling.},
